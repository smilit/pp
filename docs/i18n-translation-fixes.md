# Translation Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed 20 translation issues in `proxycast/src/i18n/patches/en.json` where English translations had concatenated words or incorrect formatting, plus fixed a critical bug in the DOM replacement algorithm that caused partial translations.

## Critical Bug Fix: DOM Replacement Order

### Problem
The DOM replacer was applying translations in an arbitrary order (based on `Object.entries()` iteration), which caused partial replacements when shorter strings were replaced before longer strings containing them.

**Example of the bug:**
- Text: "初次设置向导"
- If "初次" was replaced first → "First-time设置向导"
- Then "设置" was replaced → "First-timeSettings向导"
- Result: Broken translation like "初timesSettings向导"

### Solution
Modified `proxycast/src/i18n/dom-replacer.ts` to sort translation entries by length (longest first) before applying replacements. This ensures that longer, more specific phrases are translated before their component parts.

```typescript
// Sort patches by length (longest first) to avoid partial replacements
const sortedPatches = Object.entries(patches)
  .filter(([zh]) => !zh.startsWith('//'))
  .sort(([a], [b]) => b.length - a.length);
```

This fix ensures:
- "初次设置向导" is replaced as a complete phrase before "初次" or "设置" individually
- No partial translations or broken text
- Consistent and accurate translations throughout the UI

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Concatenated Words in Translations
These translations had words incorrectly concatenated without spaces:

| Chinese | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 请输入或选择配置文件 | Please enter InputorSelectConfigureFile | Please enter or select configuration file |
| 和其他设置 | andOther settings | and other settings |
| 名称和类型 | Nameand type | Name and type |
| 标签管理此插件的凭证 | TagsManageThisplugin's Credentials | tab to manage this plugin's credentials |
| 输入本地插件目录路径或 | InputLocalplugin directory path or  | Enter local plugin directory path or |
| 或输入新的 |  or InputNew's  | or enter new |
| 请检查内容 | Please Checkcontent | Please check content |

### 2. Incorrect Technical Term Formatting
These translations had technical terms incorrectly formatted:

| Chinese | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 凭证加载成功 | CredentialsLoad successful | Credentials loaded successfully |
| 配置保存成功 | ConfigureSave successful | Configuration saved successfully |
| 凭证添加成功 | CredentialsAdd successful | Credential added successfully |
| 凭证刷新成功 | CredentialsRefresh successful | Credential refreshed successfully |
| 已复制凭证 | CopyCredentials | Credential copied |
| 检查模型名称 | CheckModel name | Check model name |
| 上传新文件 | UploadNew file | Upload new file |
| 导入凭证文件 | ImportCredentials file | Import credentials file |
| 打开链接失败 | Failed to OpenLink | Failed to open link |
| 等待授权中 | WaitingAuthorizationing | Waiting for authorization |
| 未登录状态 | Not LoginStatus | Not logged in |
| 配置文件同步失败 | Failed to ConfigureFileSync | Failed to sync configuration file |
| 检查同步状态失败 | Failed to CheckSyncStatus | Failed to check sync status |
| 安装完成后点击 | Click after InstallComplete | Click after installation completes |

## Impact
These fixes improve the quality and readability of English translations throughout the ProxyCast application, ensuring:
- Proper spacing between words
- Natural English phrasing
- Consistent terminology
- Professional presentation
- **No more partial or broken translations**

## Files Modified
- `proxycast/src/i18n/patches/en.json` - 20 translation entries corrected
- `proxycast/src/i18n/dom-replacer.ts` - Fixed replacement order algorithm

## Testing Recommendations
1. Restart the application to ensure patches apply with the new algorithm
2. Switch language to English in Settings > General > Language
3. Navigate through all pages to verify translations display correctly
4. Specifically check the "初次设置向导" (First-time Setup) section in General Settings
5. Check for any remaining Chinese text that may not be covered by the translation files

## Technical Details

### Why Sorting by Length Matters
When replacing text, if a shorter substring is replaced before a longer string containing it, the longer string will never match. For example:

```
Original: "初次设置向导"
Translations:
  "初次" → "First-time"
  "设置" → "Settings"  
  "向导" → "Wizard"
  "初次设置向导" → "First-time Setup"

Without sorting (wrong order):
  "初次设置向导" → "First-time设置向导" (after replacing "初次")
  → "First-timeSettings向导" (after replacing "设置")
  → "First-timeSettingsWizard" (after replacing "向导")
  Result: ❌ "First-timeSettingsWizard"

With sorting (correct order):
  "初次设置向导" → "First-time Setup" (replaced as complete phrase)
  Result: ✅ "First-time Setup"
```

This is why sorting by length (longest first) is critical for accurate translations.
